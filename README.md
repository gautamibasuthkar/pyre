### Project Overview

**Title**: Pyre: Wildfire Radio Alert System for Community Resilience

**Summary**: Pyre is an innovative wildfire alert system that operates without requiring digital or cellular connectivity. Designed for high-risk communities with limited internet access, Pyre leverages radio transmission and existing fire alarm systems to provide timely evacuation alerts, protecting vulnerable populations during wildfire events.

### Challenge Description

California’s wildfire season has become a year-round crisis, exacerbated by extreme weather patterns like drought, high temperatures, and strong winds. These conditions increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, which threaten communities, infrastructure, and lives. Vulnerable populations—including elderly residents, low-income households, and people in rural areas—face barriers to timely evacuation alerts due to limited access to digital networks.

**Pyre** addresses these challenges by providing an accessible, non-digital alert system designed for use by high-risk groups. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and leveraging existing fire agency data, the system offers a reliable and accessible solution for wildfire alerts.

### Justice-Centered Vision Statement

The Pyre Alert System is dedicated to safeguarding high-risk communities through equitable access to life-saving information during wildfire emergencies. By delivering timely evacuation alerts to those often excluded from digital warnings—such as elderly, low-income, and rural residents—our solution ensures community resilience, reducing evacuation delays and promoting safety for all.

### Community Engagement Plan

1. **Identifying and Engaging the Target Audience**: Collaborate with local agencies and community organizations to reach high-risk groups, such as elderly residents, low-income households, and individuals in remote areas.
2. **Participatory Methods**: Conduct workshops and feedback sessions to ensure the system is user-friendly and culturally relevant.
3. **Equity Considerations**: Use multiple languages, simple designs, and accessible materials to reach populations with limited digital literacy.
4. **Cultural Relevance**: Work with community leaders to align the system with local customs and preferences.
5. **Contingency for Community Pushback**: Conduct additional listening sessions if there is hesitation about the project, and modify the approach based on feedback.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Outreach**  
   - Collaborate with fire departments, social services, and local organizations to identify target communities and launch project awareness.
   
2. **System Design and Development**  
   - Develop hardware and software, including a radio transmitter and API integrations. Conduct usability testing with residents to ensure accessibility.

3. **Education and Training**  
   - Organize workshops in collaboration with local non-profits to provide training, evacuation tips, and technical support in multiple languages.

4. **Pilot Program and Feedback Collection**  
   - Conduct a six-month pilot in high-risk areas. Collect feedback and data on system performance and community response.

5. **Full-Scale Deployment**  
   - Expand the system to all identified high-risk areas, address pilot issues, and ensure maintenance protocols are in place.

6. **Sustainability and Maintenance**  
   - Secure funding and partnerships for ongoing support, ensuring a community feedback loop to identify and address any issues.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration Plan

**1. Engineering and Technology**  
   - Engineers will design and develop the radio transmitter device and alert dashboard, focusing on integration with existing fire alarms.

**2. Public Health and Social Work**  
   - Public health experts will provide insights into the needs of vulnerable populations and aid in creating accessible educational materials.

**3. Emergency Management and Environmental Science**  
   - Emergency management professionals will define alert criteria and evacuation protocols.

**4. Community Advocacy and Cultural Specialists**  
   - Community advocates will ensure the project aligns with local customs and language needs.

**5. Data Analysis and User Experience Design**  
   - Data analysts and UX designers will monitor system effectiveness and ensure an intuitive user experience.
