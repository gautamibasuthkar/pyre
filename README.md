# Pyre: Wildfire Radio Alert System for Community Resilience

### Summary
The Pyre Wildfire Radio Alert System is a life-saving communication tool designed to protect vulnerable communities in wildfire-prone areas. This non-digital, satellite-enabled alert system ensures that high-risk populations—including those with limited access to internet or cellular networks—receive timely and critical evacuation notifications. Pyre also tracks whether alerts are acknowledged, allowing local authorities to prioritize rescue support based on community responses.

## Project Overview

The **Pyre Wildfire Radio Alert System** aims to bridge the communication gap for wildfire warnings in areas where digital and cellular connectivity is unreliable. Using satellite-based radio alerts, Pyre delivers evacuation warnings directly through a fire alarm system, providing a reliable and cost friendly lifeline for vulnerable communities, especially in high-risk regions like rural California.
The system also relays whether the alert has been acknowledged by residents, enabling local authorities to prioritize rescue efforts as needed.

## Challenge Description

California’s frequent and severe wildfire season is a persistent threat, particularly for elderly, low-income, and rural populations with limited access to timely evacuation alerts. Pyre provides a critical solution by bypassing digital communication limitations, using satellite alerts to notify residents directly via their fire alarms, ensuring those at high risk receive the information they need for safe evacuation. Authorities can monitor responses to ensure those who haven’t acknowledged alerts receive priority assistance.

## Justice-Centered Vision Statement

The Pyre Alert System is committed to equitable, life-saving communication during wildfire emergencies. By providing evacuation alerts to traditionally underserved groups, Pyre promotes safety and resilience for all community members, prioritizing the needs of elderly, low-income, and rural populations. Estimated costs are $7-$10, to enable accessibility for the target population.

## Community Engagement Plan

1. **Target Audience Identification**: Partner with local agencies to engage elderly, low-income, and rural residents.
2. **Participatory Methods**: Workshops and feedback sessions to ensure user-friendliness and accessibility.
3. **Cultural Relevance**: Provide multi-language support and materials aligned with community needs.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Hold listening sessions and integrate community input to refine the system.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Outreach**: Work with fire departments and social organizations to identify target areas.
2. **System Development**: Create a satellite-enabled radio transmitter with API support for real-time updates.
3. **Training**: Conduct educational sessions for community members on evacuation procedures.
4. **Pilot Program**: Run a six-month trial to gather performance feedback.
5. **Full-Scale Deployment**: Expand the system based on pilot insights and secure ongoing maintenance.

## Equity, Cultural Relevance, and Sustainability

- **Equity**: Ensure system accessibility with language support and non-digital functionality.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Adapt resources based on community preferences and input.
- **Sustainability**: Establish long-term funding and maintenance with local partnerships.

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration Plan

1. **Engineering and Technology**: Develop the alert transmission device and dashboard.
2. **Public Health and Social Work**: Address the needs of vulnerable populations and ensure materials are accessible.
3. **Emergency Management**: Define alert protocols and manage incident responses.
4. **Community Advocacy**: Align project efforts with local languages and customs.
5. **Data and UX Design**: Track system performance and ensure usability.
